# MB28KL_Builds

Mavis Bacon: 28 Keys Later is a small concept-type project I put together while learning how to make a Virtual Reality game in Unity.  In my opinion, a couple of the biggest hurdles still facing virtual reality is what to do with your actual body and how to translate in-game motion from an out-of-game, relatively static position.

Like most hurdles, the can be avoided with a little bit of game design.  Rail Shooters are a relatively older arcade-style genre wherein the motion is taken away from the player and they are guided 'on rails' through the game.  I won't claim to be a connoisseur or a critic, but one of my personal favorites is 'The Typing of the Dead'.  If you haven't played it, the game itself is a spin-off of 'The House of the Dead 2" only instead of shooting zombies on rails players have to type out words in order to slay them.

Anyways here's some basic pointers on how to setup and run the first awful level of this thing.  I personally only have an Oculus, so while I tried to add all the support options for other VR sources that Unity allows I unfortunately can't actually verify that this works on any other headset, and the below steps are based off the Oculus assumption.

1.) I mentioned earlier that this is created with Unity, I obviously had to download the development-suite to create it but I can't honestly remember if you have to download any sort of player to run Unity-based games or if they're selfed contained.  I also tried googling it but I couldn't find anything in a couple of minutes.

2.) If you have your unity stuff setup appropriately you should be able to download everything from the base directory of this project (you may have to unzip things).  You can open and run the project by clicking the MB28KL_X.XX.exe file.  

3.) If you get a wonky on-screen "Made-with-Unity" image like [this](http://imgur.com/TsQ4RcR), then check your Oculus headset which should say something about trying to run an application from an unknown source.  That's because this project isn't in the Oculus store, and it'd likely need a whole lot of polish to pass any formal review process.  If you just want to run this program, you want to make sure that the "allow from unknown sources" checkbox is checked on your [Oculus Application](http://imgur.com/B71JlSx).  Note:  This application should have opened itself automatically when trying to run a VR application.  If you trust me enough to allow this then thanks, but you should also uncheck-this for safety whenever you're done with the game.

4.) After checking the box you may have to close and re-run the program.
